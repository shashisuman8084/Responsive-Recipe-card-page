        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
            <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add garlic (and onion if using). Sauté until fragrant and the onion is translucent (about 2–3 minutes).</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes and let them cook for 5–7 minutes, breaking them down with a spoon until they form a sauce. (If using canned tomatoes, cook until the sauce thickens slightly.)</li>
            <li>Stir in basil, a pinch of salt, black pepper, and red chili flakes (if desired).</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat in the sauce.</li>
            <li>If adding vegetables (like mushrooms, bell peppers, or spinach), toss them into the skillet and cook until tender.</li>
            <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to loosen it to your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the pasta and mix well until melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer to serving plates, garnish with fresh basil leaves or parsley, and add extra Parmesan if desired.</li>
